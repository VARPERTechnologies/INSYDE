INSYDE (Intelligent System Designer): An integrated enviroment to make your own intelligent systems.


Description: INSYDE (Intelligent System Designer) is a free Integrated Development Enviroment to create, study and 
analyse Intelligent Systems, you will be able to create your own projects where you can insert objects to emulate 
basics conditions in an enviroment, also, to add components realize Intelligent proccessing like Fuzzy logic engine, 
neural networks, genetic algorithm optimization or ant colony, among others. The principal goal is to develop an 
enviroment to create intuitively and simply your own Intelligent Systems without advanced knowledge of programming 
languages or algorithms that compose the variety of tecniques or paradigms of Artificial Intelligence.

Project goals

- To develop an interface highly intuitive, simply and friendly for that users with no advanced knowledges over
  Artificial Intelligence
- To implement a plugin integration model to users can install special features to the software.
- To implement many Artificial Intelligence areas like artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic,
  expert systems, emergent computing, etc. 
- To implement an Intelligent Assistant System for less experienced users to be guided in developing their systems.

Project status

Actually this project is begining, I'm developing as starting point an Artificial Neural Network module. In this module
users can create intuitively their systems with Simulated Neural Network learning.

Method to use is so simply, users only take a ANN with mouse and place over View. After, users can place other 
input/output objects, for example, Dot matrix for pattern recognition, image objects, where you can assign an image
in diferent formats; this object can help you to make your own analyses of artificial vision. Also I will introduce
another common objects like digital dislplays, keyboard input, mouse input, audio input, audio output, video capturer,
image capturer from desktop, analogic inputs capturer.

Scope of first version (1.0.0)

In this first release it will have following features:

- ANN Toolbox:
  Multilayer Perceptron, Hopfield, Kohonen, ADALINE, Simple Perceptron

- Advanced ANN editor:
  This editor allows to see graphically each one connection and inputs of ANN at a given moment. Weights are 
  represented by colors from red to green; these colors can be adjusted in a range to adapt graphic representation

- Advanced Training Set Editor: 
  This editor allos to create your training sets from imported data or captured from any type of valid object
  coherent with such Training Set.

- Input objects:
  Dot matrix, digital display, regions, images, keyboard input, mouse input, audio input.

- Output objects:
  Binary representation, digital display, dot matrix, audio output, mouse output, image output

- Project manager:
  Like another IDE, this will have a project manager bases on XML. This allow to save current state of your system,
  current tunning data, for example, ANN weights. Also you could export all data from objects in diferent files.

Needs

Currently this project is under development, therefore, it requires a wide collaboration in diferent areas:

- Documenting all source code: source code has develped by me and lamentably I'm not a good-programing practicing,
  therefore, sometimes I don't document every fragment of code programed by myself.

- Translating source code: to share this project with many programmers in the world, it's necessary to translate code
  in english because this is cataloged like an universal language.
- Programing graphic interface: graphic interface is an important part of all project, however, my speciality is about Artificial Intelligence, whereby, it's very dificulty to dedicate
  to both things, this requires to much time and dedication.
- Variety of algorithms in AI: Artificial Intelligence has a huge number of algorithm, and this number is increasing, 
  also, exist some optimizations to other existing algorithms. These are complex and take to much time to implement.
  Because, it is necesary a contribution of AI comunity.
- UML Modeling: as a good practice of Software Engineering, it is necesary to start with a good design to obtain a 
  good developed software as optimum as posible, however, I'm actually alone in the development of this project, so
  this task is so complex to me and take much time.
